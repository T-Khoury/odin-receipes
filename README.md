# odin-receipes
This project is my first project I am completing as part of The Odin Project
I will be building a basic website which will feature a main index page and links to a few receipes.  The goal of this will be to showcase and practice what I have learned so far in HTML.

This project was great practice for writing basic HTML, as well as getting accustomed to git and the git workflow.  I made a few mistakes with formatting along the way and corrected my mistakes as I realized them.  I am excited to keep learning more and possibly improve this project in the future.
